<p>I share a vacation home with a friend, and we help defray the costs by renting it out on AirBnB. Lately I’ve noticed that a lot of web sites, for example the one below that surfaced while I was buying some replacement funiture,serve up an ad of my own AirBnB listing to me (I assume the rest of America does not see my listing multiple times a day).</p>

<p>We’ve all experienced purchasing an online item only to see it in our feeds for the next several months (thanks, but I don’t need to buy that anymore!). This goes to a whole new level of ‘why would I need that?’ At first I though Walmart Labs might need to up their game, but then I realized they’re getting paid (by AirBnB) if I click, rather than buy, and perhaps their algorithm has determined an owner might actually be likely to click on their own ad to see how others are experiencing it. I wouldn’t think AirBnB would be happy with that arrangement though, as its not really the kind of click traffic they are paying Walmart to send their way.</p>
<p>All this led me to create following very undatascientific plot:</p>
