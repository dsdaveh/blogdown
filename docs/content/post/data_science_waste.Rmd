I share a vacation home with a friend, and we help defray the costs by renting it out on AirBnB. Lately I've noticed that a lot of web sites, for example the one below that surfaced while I was buying some replacement funiture,serve up an ad of my own AirBnB listing to me (I assume the rest of America does not see my listing multiple times a day).

![Checkout click bait from Walmart Labs](../../../../post/walmart_tricks_airbnb_markup.png)

We've all experienced purchasing an online item only to see it in our feeds for the next several months (thanks, but I don't need to buy that anymore!). This goes to a whole new level of 'why would I need that?' At first I though Walmart Labs might need to up their game, but then I realized they're getting paid (by AirBnB) if I click, rather than buy, and perhaps their algorithm has determined an owner might actually be likely to click on their own ad to see how others are experiencing it. I wouldn't think AirBnB would be happy with that arrangement though, as its not really the kind of click traffic they are paying Walmart to send their way.

All this led me to create following very undatascientific plot:

```{r dsuse, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(blogdown)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

```
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height= 2, fig.width=7}
fake <- data.frame(ds = c('cure cancer ', 
                          'distract people from doing stuff so they will buy stuff instead'),
                   rank = c(.7, 1.9)) %>%
    mutate(p = str_length(ds)) 

par(mar= c(2,2,4,2))
with(fake, barplot(p, horiz = T, las =1, axes=F, 
                   col=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate'),
                   main="Proportion of data scientists doing stuff to..."))
with(fake, text(0, rank, labels = ds, pos=4))
```
